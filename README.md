Some bits and bobs regarding the Tiger Learning Computer.
The TLC was a "toy" computer that had an Apple IIe at its core.
There was a UI that would come up by default that was an early,
proprietary windowing system that was little more than a program launcher.

The TLC can be booted and you can get into Applesoft BASIC without any problem.
The problem is that I/O is pretty difficult.  No one with one of these 
machines has come forward with the ability to get anything into or out of the
existing serial port.

The goal: get data into and out of the TLC machine.  Hard to do without functional I/O.  Well, now - we have functional I/O.
